/**
 * `WalletProvider` — the wallet-pass seam (UX §1, §4.3, §7).
 *
 * Issues and updates a customer's wallet pass. Async from day one so the
 * prototype's static-map adapter and the production mint-on-demand adapter share
 * one call site (mirrors the DataStore/Transport pattern).
 *
 *  - proto: `StaticWalletProvider` maps a customer's opaque token to its
 *    pre-generated walletwallet pass URLs; `pushUpdate` is a no-op (Free tier =
 *    static snapshot, the web card is the source of truth).
 *  - prod:  `ServerWalletProvider` mints on demand and pushes via APNs / Google
 *    REST with the key held server-side (placeholder; throws here).
